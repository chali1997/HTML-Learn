    <h2>ACG</h2>
    <p><strong>ACG</strong><q>Animation,Comics,and Game</q> is term used some subcultures of Greater China and
        Southeast Aisa.Because a strong economic and cultural connection exists between anime,manga and games in the
        Japanese market,ACG is used to describe this phenomenon in relative fields.The term refers in particular to
        Japanese anime,manga and video games,with the video games usually referring to galgames.The term is not
        normally translated into Chinese;if the maning needs to be tranlated,it is usually<q><abbr
                title="animation,comics and games">动漫动画</abbr></q>,<q><abbr title="nijigen">two-dimensional
            space</abbr></q> or <q><abbr title="animation,comics and games">动漫游</abbr></q>
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>In 1995, a Taiwanese fan of animation and comics using the name <q>AIplus</q> established a board at National
        Sun Yat-sen
        University's BBS; the board was named the <q>ACG_Review Board</q>, referring to animation, comics and games.
        It is considered
        the first appearance of the term <q>ACG</q>. Popularizing by Taiwanese anime and comics critique group
        Shuffle
        Alliance, the
        arrangement of the three letters was stabilized, and the term became popular on the Chinese Mainland, in
        Hong Kong and
        Taiwan.
    </p>
    <p>
        After light novels, which are often adapted into anime, comics and video games, became more popular, the
        term <q>ACGN</q>> was
        coined. However, the term ACG is still used in the majority of situations and is generally thought to
        include light
        novels even without <q>N.</q>
    </p>
    <h2>In other regions</h2>
    <p>Japanese do not use the term ACG, though a similar concept is <q>MAG</q> meaning <q>Manga, Anime and
        Games</q>. Japanese speakers
        usually use nijigen (2次元, lit. <q>Two-dimensional space</q>) to refer a series of anime and manga culture
        (containing light
        novels and garage kits). The Otaku culture (オタク文化, Otaku bunka) refers to the related-subculture, while
        Otaku industry
        (オタク産業, Otaku sangyō) refers to related industries.</p>
    <p>In India, AVGC is used instead, referring to Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, and Comics.</p>
    <p>The term ACG is not prevalent in English-speaking regions.</p>
