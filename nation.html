                <p>For ancient seafarers, the ocean was a place of mists and uncertain landfalls. They
                    described mysterious
                    islands with godlike people, exotic creatures, and lost civilizations. Some islands magically
                    appeared
                    on
                    the horizon,only to mysteriously disappear. Early maps became populated with islands floating in the
                    oceans
                    that, in the end,
                    did not exist—as far as is known. But in between the mists of legend lie grains of truth. Maybe St.
                    Brendan
                    did set foot in
                    North America before the Vikings. Perhaps a cataclysmic natural event did inspire the fall of
                    Atlantis.Here’s what is known about six of the world’s most legendary isles.</p>
                <a href="/Error/error-2.html" target="_blank">(These fabled 'ghost' islands exist only in atlases.)</a>
                <h3>The advanced kingdom of Atlantis</h3>
                <p>Plato first wrote about the great island of Atlantis in his fourth-century b.c. dialogue, Critias. A
                    godlike
                    people
                    famous for their “bodily beauty” and “moral excellence” dominated this mystical place, situated
                    beyond
                    the
                    Pillars of
                    Hercules (today, the Strait of Gibraltar). Atlantean kings ruled from a palace guarded by a wall of
                    brass, a
                    wall of
                    tin, and a wall of copper.</p>

                    <p>Atlantis and its inhabitants continue to be immensely popular subjects in books, movies,
                        television, comic books, and
                        music. Some echo Plato’s story about hubris and destruction. One of the oddest invocations may
                        be Scottish singer
                        Donovan’s 1969 hit song, “Atlantis,” which tells how Atlantis sent out ships containing wise
                        elders, but then veers into
                        a love song to the singer’s “antediluvian baby”: “Way down below the ocean, where I want to be,
                        she may be.”</p>
                </div>
                <p>Later writers, including Sir Francis Bacon, William Blake, and American politician Ignatius Donnelly,
                    kept Atlantis in
                    the public’s consciousness, but was Atlantis really a place? Many historians and archaeologists
                    believe that a
                    historical catastrophe—an earthquake, tsunami, or vast flood— may have inspired the story. The most
                    commonly invoked
                    location is the Aegean Island of Santorini. Once a flourishing commercial center known as Thera, the
                    city and its island
                    were blown apart around 3,600 years ago in an enormous volcanic eruption, which may also have
                    triggered a tsunami.</p>
                <p>The lingering memory of this cataclysm may have shaped Plato’s tale. However, seekers after
                    historical Atlantis have
                    looked for proof in ruins in Spain, the Bahamas, and India, among other places, but to no avail. For
                    now, explorers
                    continue to look for Atlantis, or its inspiration, in sunken cities around the world.</p>

                <h3>The end-of-the-world Thule</h3>
                <p>Greek explorer Pytheas first wrote about the mysterious island of Thule in his fourth-century B.C.
                    work, On the Ocean.
                    An intrepid traveler from Massalia (today’s Marseille, France), Phytheas visited and accurately
                    described northwestern
                    Europe. Thule, he wrote, was six days’ sail north of the British Isles, along the Arctic Circle.
                    Scholar debate if
                    Phytheas made landfall himself but wrote that it had neither land, nor sea, nor air, but a mixture
                    of all three, with a
                    texture of a jellyfish.</p>
                <p>Geographers over the centuries linked Thule to a plausible variety of northern lands: Iceland,
                    Greenland, Norway, or
                    Nova Scotia (because Pytheas described its dramatic tides, which may have referred to the Bay of
                    Fundy’s massive tidal
                    range). Today, historians aren’t sure if Pytheas’s remote land was based on a real location or
                    whether it is simply a
                    stand-in for any place. Whatever the case, it shows up in the phrase “Ultima Thule”—any extremely
                    remote place on Earth.
                    And the name Thule lives on in Greenland with the Thule Air Force Base; in the Sandwich Islands, one
                    of which is South
                    Thule; and in the name of the 69th element, thulium, discovered by a Swedish chemist.</p>

                <h3>Ireland's phantom island of Hy-Brasil</h3>
                <p>Many ambitious sailors set out to discover the enchanted island of Hy-Brasil, which, according to
                    Celtic myth, lay hidden in the mists and only became visible once every seven years.
                    Fifteenth-century records from Bristol note that one Thomas Croft equipped two ships “and not with
                    the intention of trading but of exploring and finding a certain island called the Isle of Brazil.”
                    Italian explorer and navigator John Cabot apparently had Hy-Brasil on his agenda as he sailed toward
                    North America in 1498. He disappeared with his ships, however, and the details of the journey are
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>It's possible the mystery island was based on shoals to the west of Ireland, or that its occasional
                    appearance was the result of a weather inversion, which can make distant objects appear to float
                    above the horizon. The island itself gradually faded from the records.</p>

                <h3>The monk’s island of St. Brendan</h3>
                <p>Brendan was an Irish monk, born in the late fifth century A.D. Known as Brendan the Navigator, his
                    claim to fame is an epic journey to the Isle of the Blessed. The ninth-century Voyage of St. Brendan
                    the Navigator describes how the aged cleric built a curragh, a traditional Irish vessel, and set out
                    with other monks on an adventure that took him past pillars of crystal (possibly icebergs) and
                    through rains of fiery stones (possibly volcanic eruptions near Iceland). The cliffs and landing
                    place of another location visited match the coastline of the St. Kilda archipelago in Scotland’s
                    Outer Hebrides. Eventually, Brendan landed on a lush island filled with fruits and precious stones,
                    some of which he took home to Ireland.</p>
                <p>St. Brendan’s Island appeared in various locations on Atlantic Ocean maps for centuries. Defenders of
                    St. Brendan say that the land he found might actually have been North America, visited long before
                    the first Vikings arrived.</p>

                <h3>The isle of demons</h3>
                <p>In the 1500s, André Thevet, a French friar and writer, reported that sailors near the coast of
                    Newfoundland would pass a particularly frightening but unseen island. They heard men’s confused and
                    inarticulate voices and believed it was populated by demons and wild beasts.</p>
                <p>The Isle of Demons shows up on maps as early as 1508. It would seem to be a sailor’s legend were it
                    not for a very real French noblewoman, Marguerite de la Roque, who told of being marooned on the
                    island by her uncle in 1542. (The young woman had offended him by entering into an affair with an
                    officer on the ship.) Rescued and returned to France years later, she described being tormented by
                    demons at night, as well as being menaced by bears “as white as an egg.” These presumed polar bears,
                    being “vulnerable to mortal weapons,” she handily dispatched with the guns that her uncle had left
                    with her.</p>
                <p>Historians aren’t sure of the real identity of her island, though it may be Quirpon Island, Caribou
                    Island, or Fichot or Funk Islands. The noisy demons? Possibly the cacophonous flocks of seabirds
                    that nest on their shores.</p>

                <h3>The lost continent of Lemuria</h3>
                <p>The lost continent of Lemuria began as a legitimate scientific theory. Following the publi­cation of
                    Darwin’s On the Origin of Species in 1859 but before the idea of plate tectonics emerged,
                    researchers sought to understand why some animal species, such as the lemurs of Madagascar, appeared
                    on widely separated lands. Perhaps, the theory went, a land bridge had once connected Africa and
                    India. English zoologist Philip Sclater named this hypothetical land Lemuria, and scientists as
                    distinguished as Alfred Russel Wallace endorsed the idea.</p>
                <div class="small">
                    <p>The lost continent, which preceded the civilizations of Atlantis, was called Lemuria, and
                        occupied a great part of the indian ocean. It is said that Seychelles, pictured here, are among
                        the few remains of this now-sunken land.</p>

                <p>In the late 1800s, the cofounder of the spiritually questing Theosophical Society, Helena Blavatsky,
                    hijacked this concept into her own mystical Atlantean/spiritualist narrative. According to
                    Blavatsky, alien visitors had revealed to her that Lemuria was once the home of one of the “root
                    races” of humankind: seven-foot, egg-laying hermaphrodites with psychic powers. Located in the South
                    Pacific, Lemuria sank beneath the waves, but its inhabitants escaped to Central Asia. Other writers
                    took up this concept, some claiming that the Lemurians were ancestors to Atlanteans.</p>
                <p>Geology now explains the diverse locations of primate species. Nevertheless, Lemuria as an idea
                    continues to thrive in comic books, movies, and video games.</p>
